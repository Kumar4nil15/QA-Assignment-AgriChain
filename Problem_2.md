**<br>Manual Test Cases**
<br>1.	UI & Usability Testing
<br>o	Verify that the home page loads correctly with the input field and submit button.
<br>o	Check the alignment and visibility of all UI elements on different screen sizes.

<br>o	Enter a valid string (e.g., "abcabcbb") and verify that the correct output (3) is displayed.
<br>o	Check with a string having all unique characters (e.g., "abcdef") and expect output equal to the length of the string.
<br>o	Enter a string with repeating characters (e.g., "bbbbbb") and validate that output is 1.
